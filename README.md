You should be able to run `run-tests` in an exercise directory without the hassle of finding the right testing-tool and knowing the right test-file-name.

You also should be able to run `loop-tests` in an exercise directory to have yout rests run every time you change a file.

Tools that are needed sould be Provided in this Repository, but system-level things, like the interpreter for scriptinglangues, oder compilers or some kind of runtime should be installed on the system.

For every new track there has to be a run-tests-$TRACK executabele, that knows how to run tests for this track.
